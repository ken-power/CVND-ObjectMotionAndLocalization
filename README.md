# Object Motion and Localization

This repository contains code exercises and examples I completed as part of Udacity's [Computer Vision Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891) program. 

The notebooks in this repository demonstrate various computer vision applications and techniques related to object motion and localization, including: 

* [Optical Flow](Optical_Flow)
* [Robot Localization](4_2_Robot_Localization)
* [2D Histogram Filter](4_3_2D_Histogram_Filter)
* [Kalman_Filters](4_4_Kalman_Filters)
* [State_and_Motion](4_5_State_and_Motion)
* [Matrices and Transformation of State](4_6_Matrices_and_Transformation_of_State)
* [Simultaneous Location and Mapping (SLAM)](4_7_SLAM)
* [Vehicle Motion and Calculus](4_8_Vehicle_Motion_and_Calculus)
* [Landmark Detection](Project_Landmark%20Detection)
