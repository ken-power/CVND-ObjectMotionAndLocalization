    "# The Robot World\n",
    "\n",
    "A robot, much like you, perceives the world through its \"senses.\" For example, self-driving cars use video, radar, and Lidar, to observe the world around them. As cars gather data, they build up a 3D world of observations that tells the car where it is, where other objects (like trees, pedestrians, and other vehicles) are, and where it should be going! \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll be working with first a 1D then a 2D representation of the world for simplicity, and because two dimensions are often all you'll need to solve a certain problem. \n",
    "* You'll be given a set of quizzes to solve to build up your understanding of robot localization. \n",
    "* Try your best to solve these quizzes and consult the solution if you get stuck or want to confirm your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The solution will always be in either 1. a notebook which can be accessed in the `jupyter` directory in the top-left or 2. the video that comes after a quiz.* \n",

    "These grid representations of the environment are known as **discrete** representations. Discrete just means a limited number of places a robot can be (ex. in one grid cell). That's because robots, and autonomous vehicles like self-driving cars, use maps to figure out where they are, and maps lend themselves to being divided up into grids and sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll see **continuous** probability distributions when locating objects that are moving around the robot. Continuous means that these objects can be anywhere around the robot and their movement is smooth.\n",

    "We can treat this road as an array, and break it up into grid cells for a robot to understand. In this case, the road is a 1D grid with 5 different spaces. The robot can only move forwards or backwards. If the robot falls off the grid, it will loop back around to the other side (this is known as a cyclic world).\n",

    "\n",
    "Since the robot does not know where it is at first, the probability of being in any space is the same! This is a probability distribution and so the sum of all these probabilities should be equal to 1, so `1/5 spaces = 0.2`. A distribution in which all the probabilities are the same (and we have maximum uncertainty) is called a **uniform distribution**.\n"
